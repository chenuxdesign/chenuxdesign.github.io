					   <div class="description">
					       <p>(1) Assessment planning is the most core product of Tk20 system and it was built since the beginning of the company (around 2003). Throughout the past 12 years, lots of functions have been added without enough consideration of overall information architecture and user experience. 
							  <br>(2) Assessment Planning is a very complex product. It involves 100+ pages, 4 types of users and more than 15 major sub-components. 
							  <br>(3) Customer institutions have different processes and they use the system differently to accommodate their needs. So it is very challenging to balance between keeping the simplicity of interfaces and meeting needs from different customer institutions.  
							  <br>(4) Getting data on studentsâ€™ learning consistently and correctly is the foundation of good assessment planning. But most of the faculty who are responsible to collect the data, have resistance in getting involved in the assessment process. </p>

					   <div class="description">
					       <p>To fully understand the processes and needs of customers, several rounds of user interviews were conducted. We not only want to find out how they use our system, more importantly, we want to learn their processes and challenges, how different roles use the system, and how needs shift in different phases of assessment cycles. Along with the research, I brainstormed and worked on different concepts. There were a lot of team reviews to discuss about the design. After getting a better sense of the product direction and architecture, I iterated on the design with Axure wireframes and put them in front of our customers.</p>

					       <p>(1) Redesign the overall information architecture and user flows. 
							<br>(2) Help users digest information better through visual cues and data visualization. 
							<br>(3) Reduce the amount of work user needs to do through better data collection functions.
							<br>(4) Provide better reporting functions that help programs and faculty make sense of data collected. </p>
