								    <p>There are different ways for a player to get help about a game, ask friends and family for help, search for help online, post question in a game forum, etc. Wait, how about providing help right in game? It has been an overlooked area for most games because usually during a game development process, providing help content and service is more an afterthought rather an integral part of the process. At EA, I got opportunities to work on a couple of in-game help projects that helped change this pattern.

					       <h4>Design Challenges</h4>
					   </header>
					   <div class="description">
					       <p>It is the first time that standard EA support service is incorporated in a console game. So there wasnâ€™t much existing knowledge and guidelines to build upon and follow. Also the project had a pretty tight deadline due to the game launch schedule. Thus, our goal was to design and ship an easy and smooth in-game support experience based on our experience on help.ea.com and learn from there.
                        </p>
					   </div>
					 
					   <header>
					       <h4>Design Process</h4>
					   </header>

					   <div class="description">
					       <p>Due to the nature of game play on console (PS4, PS3, XBOX ONE, XBOX 360), clicking and tabbing through from one action to another are the major interactions. On the other hand, typing and interact with browser windows is pretty unpleasant experience on console devices. So in the design, we kept these in mind and designed a flow that is easy for players to navigate and make selections. <br>
					       <br> After some initial concepting and sketching, I created interactive prototypes and tested it with several internal players. The feedback was incorporated in the final design.
					       </p>

					       <h4>Results and reflection</h4>
					   </header>
						<div class="description">
					       <p>(1) Within a few months after the launch, lots of players have clicked on the Help button and read help articles in Battlefield 1 which is very impressive. The helpfulness score of these articles were higher compared to help.ea.com which validated our approach of providing help articles based on context. </br></br>
					       	(2) The project is overall successful but there are still questions about how console players perceive in-game help and what they expect it to be. We have provided some basic help functions in game but how we could improve in the future? In the next project, I utilized usertesting.com to interview console players and discovered some interesting patterns.

					       <h3>In-game help study</h3>
					   </header>	
			   	      
				       <header>
					       <h4>The goal</h4>
					   </header>
					   <div class="description">
					       <p> The study was to learn about how console and mobile game players perceive and use help in game and what they expect to have for in-game help.
                           </p>
					   </div>
					   <header>
					       <h4>The process</h4>
					   </header>

					   <div class="description">
					       <p>For this study, I used Usertesting.com to collect thoughts from players regarding in-game help. For people who aren't familiar with Usertesting.com, it is an online service that help you get videos of real people speaking their thoughts as they use your websites, mobile apps, or prototypes. The reason for using this tool is mainly because it could reach to a large number of target audience with low cost and very short waiting time. With this tool, I was able to get 50 interview responses within a few hours. </p>

					       <!--<p> Since the study was conducted online with no moderator, it is important to make sure the questions and instructions are clear and concise. The major questions I asked in script are: <br><br>
					       	- Please tell us your experience regarding getting help while playing games on console. Please specify things below: (1) the game name; (2) the type of game issue you encountered that you needed help with; (3) where did you go to look for help; (4) how you resolved the issue if you resolved it. [Verbal Response] <br>
					       	- When you have a game related issue while playing a game on console, where do you prefer to go to look for help? [Multiple Choice: Look for help in game, Look for help on mobile/desktop device, Ask help from friends or family, Other]<br>
					       	- Please elaborate on why you made that selection in the previous question. If you didn't select the option "Look for help in game", please elaborate on your thoughts about in-game help and why you don't prefer to look for help in game. [Verbal Response]<br>
					       	- If there is a Help page within the game on console, what would you like to have on that page to support your in-game experience? Explain why you would like to have certain content or functions on the help page. [Verbal Response]<br>
					       	- If there is a Help page within the game, where do you expect to click to enter into that help page? Explain why. [Verbal Response]<br>

					       <h4>Study results and outcome</h4>
					       </header>

					       <p> I reviewed all the test videos and documented important notes in a spreadsheet. After some deep analysis, I put the results into a one-page summary that is easy to scan and digest. The results reveal several interesting insights that are different from how we thought about in-game help. It provides inspirations and directions for future in-game help projects. <br><br>For details of the study results, please contact me (liangchen8844@gmail.com) about it or I could show you in person.
