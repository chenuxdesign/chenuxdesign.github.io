								    <p>Good design not only brings people aesthetic value, it also influences and shapes users' behavior in certain ways to achieve design goals. By knowing more about human's behavioral patterns, designers could make their work more effective.</p>

								<div class="descriptionright">
									<p>There are many excellent design pattern websites that provide inspirations on the visual side of design, but there weren't many that address the behavior side. In the summer of 2013, I researched and designed the behavior pattern library for PatternTap at ZURB.<br> ( The site has been redesigned recently. )</p>

					       <h4>Research</h4>
					   </header>
					   <div class="description">
					       <p>By researching on existing articles, books and websites about behavior patterns, I identified 76 behavior patterns that could be applied to design work. Along with identifying these patterns, I looks through tons of design work to collect design examples for each of the patterns. <br><br>
					       After that, I interviewed designers to find out how they would use this type of design library from which I learnt that: 
						   <br>(1) When designers look for design examples, they often have some kind of goal in mind. 
						   <br>(2) When designers look for behavior patterns, it is very likely for them to know the exact name of the patterns.</p>

					       <p>(1) Home Page: In order to help designers to find the right design pattern, the home page of the library is organized by common design goals. Once user finds the design goals that they are interested in, he/she could click on the card of that goal to view all the behavioral patterns related to that goal or click on a behavior pattern to learn more about it.</p>
