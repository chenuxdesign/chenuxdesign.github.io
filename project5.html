					       <h4><b>Goal</b></h4>
					   </header>
                      
					   <div class="description">
					       <p>Contacting EA is one of the top reasons why players come to EA Help. To contact EA, a player needs to provide necessary information about the issue so the system could route the player to proper contact options. The goal of the redesign is to make it an easy and seamless experience to submit a contact request.  <br><br>
					       A few outstanding design issues with the previous design:
<br>1.It was cumbersome and took many steps before you could submit your contact request. 
<br>2.It wasn’t optimized for mobile devices.
<br>3.There was no alternative flow for cases like when players forget their passwords.


					       </p>

								<h4><b>The redesign</b></h4>
					        </header>
					   </div>
					        <p>1. Case information page <br>
							Instead of filling out information on three different pages, new design consolidates all the case information questions on one page. Also in the old design you have to keep clicking on Next button to see next field which is really tedious. In the new design, filling out one field will auto scroll you to next field which makes the flow more smooth and enjoyable.</p>
					   
					    <div>

					    </div>
				         <br>

                        
<p>2. Channel selection page <br>
There are usually more than one contact options available based on the player’s location. The new design highlight the recommended option by making it open by default and collapsing all the other options. <br>Also, in the new design, if the issue a player has can be potentially resolved by an article or an online tool, we will provide the solution on this page as a recommended support option. </p>
                        <div class="projectimage54">
					    </div>
				        <br>
                        <p>3. Case confirmation page <br>
                        Submitting a contact confirmation is not the end. We provide ways for players to look for information related to their issue while they are waiting to be contacted. </p>
                        <div class="projectimage55">
					    </div>
				        <br>

							<p>4. Self-help and deflection <br>
								In the new contact flow design, we introduced different ways to prompt players with self-help solutions for certain issues. This helps players to get help they need quicker without having to contact EA.</p>

<p>5. Mobile breakpoint redesign<br>
Around 40% of traffic to EA Help website are from mobile and the number is still increasing. Hence it is very important to optimize the experience on mobile devices. Filling out forms on mobile could be intimidating and badly designed forms could easily make players lose confidence in the support service and drop off. We want to support players who need help. With concise page layout and intuitive interaction, contacting EA on mobile becomes a simple process.

                     <header>
                       <h4><b>User testing</b></h4>
                   </header>

                       <p>We did user testings with players and modified the design based on test results.
                       </p>

                    <div class="projectimage56">
                   </div>


                    <header>
                       <h4><b>Result and impact</b></h4>
                   </header>

                       <p>With the redesign, the effort it takes to submit a contact request is greatly reduced. After the launch of the new design, the completion rate of contact flow has been increased by more than 20%, which means thousands more players get helped each month.
                       </p>
                       <header>
                       <h3>Article page redesign</h3>
                          </header>
                   <p>EA help articles are the top visited pages on EA Help. Creating easy to navigate and scan articles would help players find solutions faster. We leveraged an existing EA pattern library for common components like title, header and buttons. For specific needs from content team, I designed new components that both meet the needs and provide good experience across devices.

                       <h3>Reflection</h3>
                          </header>
                          <p>1. Delivering design document is not the end. Collaborating with developers during development on a regular basis is crucial in reducing UI bugs and get high quality products. Designers should stand up and set a bar for quality build. At the other side, conversations with developers could help designers think more thoroughly about logic and interaction details in design. <br><br>
                              2. Having clearly defined goal and success metrixs is the key to a successful project.
                              <br><br>
                              3. The redesign is not perfect but I am confident that it is in a much better position for future enhancement and iteration.
                          </p>
