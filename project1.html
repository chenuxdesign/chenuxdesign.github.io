								<div class="descriptionleft">
								    <p>Zaocanjia is a startup based in Beijing, China. They design and produce healthy breakfast and deliver it to people in major business districts of Beijing. They have been utilizing the business channel within Wechat (NO.1 communication app in China) as the major online medium to reach to their customers.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="descriptionright">
									<p>The functions of the business channel limited the growth of their business so I was brought on board to design their custom site for the channel. Since the majority of customers use WeChat on their mobile phones, building a mobile site becomes the first priority.</p>

					       <h4>The Goal</h4>
					   </header>
					   <div class="projectimage13">
					   </div>
					   <div class="description">
					       <p>In super big cities in China like Beijing, commute to work could take long which makes morning time precious. People who wish to eat healthier only find themselves getting low quality food from street side. What we aim to achieve is not only to provide a solution for people to get healthy breakfast easily, we also want to foster the habit of getting healthy breakfast everyday.</p>
					   </div>

					       <h4>Process and Design</h4>
					   </header>
					   <div class="description">

					       <p>After competitor analysis and initial user research, I started to sketch out the use flow and interfaces. To make the ordering process as simple as possible, the design went through several rounds of iterations. See some iterations of homepage elements below as an example: </p>
					   </div>
					   <div class="projectimage14">
					   </div>
				       <br>
 					  
 					   <p><b>Purchase Process</b>: Purchase process is the most important part. We don't want to overwhelm users with too much information and form fields on one page but also we keep in mind that too many steps would make some users leave. </p>
					   <div class="projectimage">
					   </div>
					    <br>
					   <p><b>View My Orders</b>: View orders is another key function. This function is a challenging one because users not only need to check if they have ordered breakfast for certain days, they also need to see the status of their today's order if there is one. In the final design, a calendar is used to help users to quickly scan their order history.</p>
					   <div class="projectimage15">
					   </div>
					   
					   
					   <br>


					   <header>
					       <h4>Future Strategies</h4>
					   </header>
					   <div class="description">
					       <p>For the second release, a very important function "Subscription" will be added. This new feature will greatly reduce the efforts of users who order breakfast on daily basis and more importantly, it will help shape users habit of getting breakfast from Zaocanjia everyday.</p>
					   </div>
					    <div class="projectimage12">

					       <h4>Released View</h4>
					   </header>
					   <div class="description">
					       <p>This mobile site was launched in 2015 January. It helped double the customer number of Zaocanjia so far.</p>
